# The Odin Project - Landing Page Exercise


## Description
This is an exercise from [The Odin Project's Foundations course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths).

In this mini-project, I had to use HTML, CSS and Flex Box to develop a landing page similar to one of those you can find on the web.

## Skills involved
- HTML
- CSS
- Git
- Redaction

## Difficulties encountered
Even if I knew most of the things on the CSS I have seen since this step, Flex Box is a tricky notion to work with. It was a good reminder on how to use it.

It is also one of the first "README" that I write, so I don't know what I have to say in it.

Thank you for reading !
